Wedding Website Template
==============

Beach-themed website template for a wedding, featuring the following sections:
* RSVP
* Details
* Crew
* Photographs 
* Request A Song

The navigation had two pure CSS3 crabs that are animated.

In the RSVP section, users can RSVP to the wedding where each RSVP is sent via FormSpree to whatever email you speficy.
In the Details section, there is a calendar and an invitation with a CSS envelope.
In the Crew section, the groomsman/bridemaids and groom and brided are featured.
In the Photographs section, you can upload the photos from the wedding.
In the Request A Song section, the Spotify API is used to allow users to search for songs. Users can select a song and submit it, where it is sent as an email using FormSpree again.

The site is structured in such a way so that you can utilize Jekyll to add blog posts to this site. 
I originally did this so that I could utilize Disqus so that guests could post comments on the site in an experimental section called "Post A Memory".
This was done in hopes that guests would post memories that the Best Man and Maid of Honor could use in their speeches.

This site was made for my mom, who is getting married. Her site, which uses this template, can be seen here:
